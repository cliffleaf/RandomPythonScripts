In WeChat, users can upload at maximum 9 images, arranged in 3x3 matrix.

So it looks cool if we divide one image into nine pieces, and upload them by the order in which the fragments merges into the original image.


For example, below is the original image (from donghua "Fairies Album 百妖谱")

And below is the final product (the WeChat post)
